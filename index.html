					<h1>Why I would be interested in this job</h1>
					<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 15px;">I would be interested in this job because I have always been interested in computer science. In order to earn this position you must have some experience with computer programming. In my spare time, I love working with html, css and javascript and sometimes a little bit of python to code things I find interesting. For example, a while ago I was working on a recipe website using the programming language html and css which added to my passion for computers. Being a systems analyst, you develop, analyze and test IT systems and find ways to improve them, which I thought would be quite interesting. I want to find ways to improve technology systems to make it more efficient for others.</span></p>
