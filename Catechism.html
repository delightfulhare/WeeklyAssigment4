				<h2>Explanation of how the career chosen helps fulfill the vocation of God</h2>
				<p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 15px; color: #0e1b17;"> The vocation of God concerns the human community as a whole. This would mean that because the job of a systems analyst requires the improvement of IT systems, those who are doing the job must improve it for the entire human community; not just for one person.</p>
